My first git repository.
I'm a student at Utah State University.
I like to be part of the computer science community.
I already know Hg, but am excited to learn Git.
I know C++ and Java. Recently I've made some GUIs in [JavaFX](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/get-started-tutorial/jfx-overview.htm)
